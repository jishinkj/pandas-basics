# Pandas for Beginners

The [notebook](pandas-basics.ipynb) in this repository explains the basics of the popular data manipulation library in Python - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 

The datasets used in this repository can be found in the `data` folder, except the `PUBG_train.csv` used in the Memory Optimization section. This dataset wasn't added because of its size (638 MB). You can find the PUBG dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data). Make sure you rename the `train_V2.csv` to `PUBG_train.csv`. 

The notebook explores the following topics - 

* The Pandas dataframe
* Head and Tail
* Load CSVs
* Load Excels
* Creating Dataframes
* Slicing, indexing
* Identifying, dropping and imputing missing values
* Unique values and number of unique values
* Sorting
* Grouping
* Types of Joins
* Merge 
* Export to CSV
* Memory optimization
