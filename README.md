# Pandas for Beginners

The notebook in this repository explains the basics of the popular data manipulation library in Python - Pandas. 

The datasets used in this repository can be found in the `data` folder except the `PUBG_train.csv` used in the Memory Optimization section. This dataset wasn't added because of its size (638 MB). You can find the PUBG dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data). Make sure you rename the `train_V2.csv` to `PUBG_train.csv`.
